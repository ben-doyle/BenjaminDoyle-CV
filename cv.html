				<div class="sectionContent">
          <p>As a Software developer, I love progressing the code, ideas and team culture. I like to keep my skills broad, and love working in multiple programming languages. I consider
            myself an all-round software engineer, as I like and tend to be able to adjust to the technical stack the project requires.
            Before entering software development my background consisted of hands on techical and desktop support roles.</p>
          <p> Recently I became a licenced skydiver and it takes almost all of my spare time. However when the weather isn't so great I like to 3D print, make music, run and enter long 
            distance hiking events (~100km), doing these things helps keeps me keep a healthy work-life balance while staying fit and sharp.

            <p class="subDetails"><strong>Software Engineer III (iOS Native)</strong></p>
  					<p class="subDetails">April 2022 - Present</p>
  					<p>When given the opportunity to become an iOS developer I jumped at the chance to learn more about the mobile and native app space. I started this role with no previous native development experience.
              As we used a server-driven architecture, the knowledge I gained through working on the SDUI back-end API helped greatly in understanding the architecture of our native app space. </p>
            <p> 
              During this time I have to ramped-up and interviewed new iOS developers onto our architecture and iOS development processes. I enjoy iOS development quite a lot, but I still enjoy and seek out opportunities 
              to work up and down the techical stack. I have recently started a rotation to another team as an iOS developer with back-end experience.

            <p class="subDetails"><strong>Software Engineer II/III</strong></p>
  					<p class="subDetails">March 2020 - Present</p>
  					<p>In this role, I am primarily a back-end Kotlin developer, however, I work to help maintain a variety of both back and front-end systems.</p>
            <p>One of my most notable projects includes being part of the team migrating a high traffic application in Expedia from a client sided legacy system, to an API first server-driven UI architecture. The stack we used
              for this was Kotlin, GraphQL interfacing with a gRPC lower layer.</p>
            <p>In this project I was responsible  for all aspects of the API; including but not limited to designing UI data schema (and taking it from schema to code) and ensuring all clients (web, mobile web, 
              native iOS/Android) agreed on a single schema. This ensuring there was no downtime between implmentation and/or changes.</p>

            <p class="subDetails"><strong>Software Engineer I</strong></p>
  					<p class="subDetails">September 2017 - February 2020</p>
  					<p>Full-stack engineer, working with Java (back-end), and React (front-end). My most notable project during this time was supporting building and maintaining a react PWA with a node middle-layer API.</p>
            <p>I ran a community sync meeting of React developers spread in multiple timezones, to share ideas, learnings and updates. During this time I (outside of work) helped to support ReactBris meetup in our office.</p>
